In order to improve the image loading speed, it is recommended to optimize the image size:
1. Open [compressed image](https://www.yasuotu.com/) to upload your own screenshot, adjust the height of the image to `360px` and download it.
2. Upload the compressed picture to [去不图床](https://7bu.top/) and use the picture link as the screenshot link.
